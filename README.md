# Node.js CRUD API
# Overview
This project is a Node.js CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API that allows you to interact with a database using HTTP requests. It's designed to be well-organized and maintainable, with clear separation of components.

# Components
# Controller
The controller is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and sending appropriate HTTP responses. It acts as an intermediary between the routes and the business logic. In this CRUD API, the controller has four main functions:

**Create**: Handles the creation of new records.

**Read**: Retrieves and returns data from the database.

**Update**: Modifies existing records.

**Delete**: Removes records from the database.

The controller parses request data, interacts with the model to perform necessary operations, and sends back the response to the client.

# Model
The model represents the business logic of the application. It defines the structure of the data, interacts with the database, and enforces validation rules. In this CRUD API, the model typically includes:

**Schema**: Defines the structure of your data and the relationships between different entities.

**CRUD Operations**: Functions to create, read, update, and delete records in the database.

**Validation Logic**: Ensures that data is correctly formatted and follows business rules.
# Utils
The utils folder contains database connection and utility functions that are used throughout the application. It might include:

**Database Connection**: Code to establish a connection to your chosen database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

**Authentication**: Functions for user authentication, if your API requires user accounts and authorization.

**Utility Functions**: Helper functions for common tasks like error handling, data formatting, or response generation.

# Route
The route folder defines the API endpoints and their associated controller methods. It specifies how incoming HTTP requests are routed to the appropriate controller functions. For example:

/api/users might route to the user controller for CRUD operations on user data.

/api/products might route to the product controller for managing products.

Each route can be mapped to one or more CRUD operations.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository.

Install dependencies: npm install.

Set up your database connection in the utils/db.js file.

Start the server: npm run start.
# API Endpoints
POST /api/resource: Create a new record.

GET /api/resource: Retrieve all records.

PUT /api/resource/id: Update a specific record by ID.

DELETE /api/resource/id: Delete a specific record by ID.

Replace resource with the entity you're working with (e.g., users, products).
